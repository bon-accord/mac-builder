# Mac Builder

## Summary

- This repo is designed as a self-contained set of Ansible playbooks and roles to let you manage your MacOS developer tooling
- It is intended to be run on a new or existing MacOS developer laptop
- It assumes the OS is installed and configured

## Prerequisites

- Install Apple command-line tools (optional): `xcode-select --install`
- Add Python3 & Homebrew to your path: `export PATH=â€œ$HOME/Library/Python/3.8/bin:/opt/homebrew/bin:$PATH"`
- Upgrade pip: `sudo pip3 install --upgrade pip`
- Install Ansible: `pip3 install ansible`

## Setup

The following setup tasks should be performed or borne in mind before running the playbook(s):

- Ansible Vault should be used to create and encrypt the following file: `ansible/group_vars/all/vault.yml`
- 

## How to Use

- Clone this repo
- Change into ansible dir: `cd ansible`
- Run the playbook: `ansible-playbook --vault-password-file ~/.vaultpass.txt install.yml`

## Manual Tasks Not Automated

The following tasks are not automated and still need to be done manually:

### Chrome Extensions

Chrome extensions [can be implemented automatically](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/external_extensions/) by creating a JSON file of the extension id, e.g. `jpmkfafbacpgapdghgdpembnojdlgkdl.json` under one of the following locations:

```
~/Library/Application\ Support/Google/Chrome/Default/Extensions
~/Library/Application\ Support/Google/Chrome/External\ Extensions/
```

Such a file would typically look like this:

```
$ cat jpmkfafbacpgapdghgdpembnojdlgkdl.json
{
    "external_update_url": "https://clients2.google.com/service/update2/crx"
}
```

For reasons of simplicity and maintenance, this is better done manually.
